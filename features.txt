Features

- ratings (stars/comments) per item 
- ratings (stars/comments) per dining hall
- dining hall account admin privileges to ratings and suggestions
- suggestions/comments for dining halls 
    - these can then be upvoted or downvoted like yik-yak to see top ideas that people want
- allow user to favorite certain items 
- notify users when favorited items are being served that day
- create "friends" network
    - create "check-in" system so users can see where "friends" are eating
- live comments/message board about line length, food amount, seating availability

Questions:
- how do we handle when dining hall menu is not posted 
- users that have not created an account/logged in
    - they should still be able to see the menus just not get above features 
- how many times are we gonna make the call to ASPC? 
    - if it is just once then we can store that in the state? and each day make a new call and replace the data in the store?


To Do:
- we will need to create login 
- figure out a dev environment where we can simulate data from ASPC
- create databases for many things
    - Users: 
        - USERID (can be email probably), favorite items, ???, ???, ???
    - Comments/Suggestions:
        - dont need an author since all comments should be anonymous 
        - MESSAGE, Upvotes, Downvotes, DiningHall
        OR should this be 7 rows (one for each dining hall) and then keep track of the messages that way (i dont think thats right)
